## The Command to be Humble

## How We Can be Humble
*Taken from [2]*
### Thanking God often and always
#### Hebrews 13:15-17
```json
15 Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. 16 Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God. 17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you. 
```

### Confessing your sins regularly (to God and to people)
#### 1 John 1:9
```json
9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
```

#### James 5:16
```json
16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.
```

### Be ready to accept humiliations
#### Matthew 23:12
```json
12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
```

### Don’t worry about status
Don’t try and connect with people to elevate yourself. Is that person going to make me look good? Having that job, will that make me look good? Having that house? That spouse? Don’t try and elevate yourself; rather, try to elevate others. Serve others.

People who are humble inspire trust and confidence from those around them, and therefore humility is key for leadership.6 Pride is anti-social behaviour, whereas when we’re humble, it’s best for others and best for us, as it’s who we were created and redeemed to be.

### Have a sense of humour
When we’re able to laugh at ourselves, we more quickly swallow our pride. It diffuses situations. It means we’re not trying to keep up a facade that we’re this person who has it altogether. It means we can more quickly admit we’re wrong. It means we’re more real. It means we’re more in tune with grace. It means we’re more in tune that other people will have similar struggles to us in the Christian walk. Being able to laugh at ourselves is really important. It can help prevent burnout. It helps us keep going in life and ministry.

### Listen to others
Listening to others shows we’re willing to learn from them, that we want to learn from them, whether they’re adults or children, whatever the persons’ background, Christian or not.

When we feel listened to, we feel loved. And when we listen to others, it’s a sign of us loving them and an acknowledgement that we can learn from them. And it’s also recognition that God in his sovereignty and goodness has put this person in my life.

### Ask questions
This is closely related to the point above about listening to others. When we ask questions in a right attitude and manner it shows we recognize we don’t have all the answers, that maybe our preconceived ideas about something were in fact wrong. It can also show that we recognize the person’s authority over us (if that is the case) and we are submitting to them. It can show we assume trust in them. There are many varied and different situations in life when it would be good for us to ask questions, aren’t there?

If you’re not in the habit of asking questions, it might be embarrassing at first, but it becomes easier. For example, when you’re chatting with someone and they use a word you don’t know, ask them the definition. If you don’t understand other things they’re saying, ask them to clarify. It’s often our pride that stops us asking questions of clarification.

There are many situations where we can ask questions of others that help us grow in humility, but one of the greatest ways is to ask God questions in prayer and when we read his word the Bible.

#### Consider others before yourself
> “Humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less”
- John Stott

Humility is not thinking that others are more godly or kind than you, more intelligent or nicer, better at cooking or cricket than you. They may be, they may not be. Humility is when you consider other people’s interests before your own, thinking what is best for the other person and acting on that. We’re being humble when we think of others before ourselves. You may have a greater status than someone. You may have authority over someone. You don’t pretend you don’t have authority over them, but you think of what will benefit the people under you. What do they need? What is best for them? It doesn’t mean you don’t look after yourself. When we don’t look after ourselves we soon can’t help anyone else.
