## What is *worship*, simply?
#### 1 Peter 2:9
```json
9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
```

> Worshiping is `publicly` and `privately` professing God's glory, and being in His presence.

## Requires conscious preparation on the part of the worshiper
#### Ecclesiastes 5:1
```json
1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
```

> We've got to watch our hearts, and be ready to be in God's presence. When we're barely paying attention, more focused on who is there and who isn't, or our mind is wandering, we're sinning.

## Encourages private and family worship as a complement to corporate public worship
#### Deuteronomy 6:6-7
```json
6 And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. 7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
```

#### Acts 2:46-47
```json
46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
```

> Not only do we worship at church, but in our homes, with our children, as we instruct them in the Word and praise God together.

## Demands the response of the whole person to God as Creator and Redeemer
#### Matthew 15:8-9
```json
8 This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me;
9 in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
```

> Worship Him with your body (singing, kneeling out of respect, dressing appropriately out of reverence), and worship Him with your heart (from the preparation: knowing He is worthy, and )

## Encourages congregational worship that was active and participatory
#### Psalm 40:3
```json
3 He put a new song in my mouth,
a song of praise to our God.
  Many will see and fear,
and put their trust in the LORD.
```

> David is telling us both how God demands a response to Him, and how others saw and trust God. It's encouraging to the other members of the Body of Christ.

#### Psalm 57:9
```json
9 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
  I will sing praises to you among the nations.
```

> Again, singing in front of people, in front of everybody.

## Has elements of confession and absolution
#### 1 John 1:9
```json
9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
```

#### James 5:16
```json
16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.
```

#### Proverbs 28:13
```json
13 Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
   but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
```

> Confessing to God and one another is both commanded and beneficial. It relinquishes our supposed power over our lives to God, and kills sin. Sin doesn't have power over us anymore.

## Assumes that a lifestyle of obedience in service to God completes the integrity of worship
#### Psalm 100:2
```json
2 Serve the LORD with gladness!
  Come into his presence with singing!
```

#### Psalm 2:11
```json
11 Serve the LORD with fear,
and rejoice with trembling.
```

#### Luke 4:8
```json
8 And Jesus answered him, “It is written,
“‘You shall worship the Lord your God,
and him only shall you serve.’”
```
> Serve Him in all that we do gladly, out of thankfulness.

## Encourages us to go out and proclaim the Good News
#### Isaiah 6:1-8
```json
1 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one called to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;
the whole earth is full of his glory!”

4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”

6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 7 And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

8 And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me."
```

#### Matthew 28:16-20
```json
16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 17 And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
```

> One fact stands out to me: those early Christians evangelized almost "by accident." Evangelism sprang from their worship. Their worship witnessed to the awesome display of God's presence and power. Unbelievers were drawn to Christ through their worship and, in turn, their worship compelled them to tell others about him. <sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>
