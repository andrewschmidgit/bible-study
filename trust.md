## What do we have trouble trusting God with? In general?
Any sort of hardship / situation in which we do not see the outcome / situation where we thought we knew the outcome but changed.

## What is trust?
Trust is an action. A continuous action.

#### Proverbs 3:5-6
```
5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
and do not lean on your own understanding.
6 In all your ways acknowledge him,
and he will make straight your paths.
```

## What are some of God promises to us if we trust Him?

#### Jeremiah 17:7-8
```
7 “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,
whose trust is the LORD.
8 He is like a tree planted by water,
that sends out its roots by the stream,
and does not fear when heat comes,
for its leaves remain green,
and is not anxious in the year of drought,
for it does not cease to bear fruit.”
```
- Does not fear
- Not anxious, even when you don't hear from God
- Never fails to bear fruit

#### Isaiah 43:2
```
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
and the flame shall not consume you.
```
- He will be with us
- The rivers won't sweep over us
- The flames won't consume us

# Relationship with God / The trials of a Christian life

## How God regards us
This section is meant to show that God is who justified us at the time of salvation, which means we are credited with Jesus’ blood, from that point onward. It’s not up to us afterwards, we are covered fully and completely. This should give us peace through everything in life, and bring us joy.

## Before Salvation

#### Psalm 14:1-3
```
None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. 12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one
```

#### Psalm 51:5
```
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
and in sin did my mother conceive me.
```

#### Romans 3:19-23
```
Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
```
These verses show us that we are born in sin, and born as enemies of God.

The law is both God’s commands (which therefore set the standards for right and wrong) and a mirror that we hold up to ourselves and shows us what we really are.

## After Salvation

### Justification
> the action of declaring or making righteous in the sight of God.

#### Romans 3:24
```
and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
```

#### Romans 3:28
```
For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
```

#### Romans 4:5
```
And to the one who does not work but believes in (trusts) him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
```

#### Romans 5:10
```
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
```

#### 2 Corinthians 5:19-20
```
that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
```

### Saving Grace

#### Romans 5:1
```
Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
```

#### Colossians 1:20
```
For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
```

#### 1 Peter 1:3-4
```
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
```

# Trials and Tribulations

## Suffering for the sake of Christ

#### 1 Peter 4:12-19
```
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. 14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. 16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name. 17 For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 And

“If the righteous is scarcely saved,
what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”

19 Therefore let those who suffer according to God’s will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.
```

## Our cross to bear

#### Mark 8:34
```
And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
```

#### Acts 14:22
```
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
```

## Trials

#### 1 Peter 1:3-7
```
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, 5 who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, 7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
```

## What God uses trials for

#### Romans 5:3-5
```
Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
```

#### Romans 8:28-29
```
And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. 29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
```

#### 2 Corinthians 1:8-9
```
For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers,2 of mthe affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. 9 Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us nrely not on ourselves obut on God pwho raises the dead.
```

#### 2 Corinthians 4:7-10
```
But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; 10 always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.
```

#### 2 Corinthians 12:8-10
```
But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; 10 always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. 
```

#### 1 Peter 1:6-7
```
In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, 7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
```

# Satan and the forces against us
The cross is what the world did to God, and what it does to us, now that we are no longer of the world. 

#### 1 Peter 4:14
```
```

## The Devil

#### 1 Peter 5:8
```
Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
```

#### 1 Timothy 3:6
```
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
```

#### 1 John 3:8
```
The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work.
```

## The World

#### John 15:18-21
```
18 “If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. 21 But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.
```

#### 1 John 5:19
```
We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
```

#### John 8:44
```
You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies
```

## Sinful Nature

#### Ephesians 2:3
```
Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
```

#### Galatians 5:19-21
```
Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
```

# Our Responsibility / What He said we should do

## Put on the Armor of God

#### Ephesians 6:10-20
```
10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. 14 Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. 16 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; 17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 18 praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, 19 and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
```

## Pray

#### 1 John 5:14
```
And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
```

#### Luke 22:42
```
saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.
```

#### Ephesians 6:18
```
praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
```

#### Matthew 26:41
```
“Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
```

#### Romans 8:26
```
In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
```

## Go to Church

#### Hebrews 10:23-25
```
Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.
```

#### Ecclesiastes 4:9-12
```
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
```

## Confession / Absolution

#### 1 John 1:9
```
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
```

#### Proverbs 28:13
```
Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
```

#### Psalm 32:5
```
5 I acknowledged my sin to you,
and I did not cover my iniquity;
I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,”
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.
```

## Rejoice

#### 1 Peter 4:12-13
```
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
```

#### James 1:2-4
```
Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
```

#### James 5:13
```
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. 
```

# Christ’s Responsibility / What He said He would do

#### 1 Corinthians 10:13
```
No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
```

#### Philippians 4:11-13,19
```
11 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
...
19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
```

#### Psalm 37:3-7,23-24
```
3 Trust in the LORD, and do good;
dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.

4  Delight yourself in the LORD,
and he will give you the desires of your heart.

5  Commit your way to the LORD;
trust in him, and he will act.

6  He will bring forth your righteousness as the light,
and your justice as the noonday.

7  Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him;
fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way,
over the man who carries out evil devices!

23 The steps of a man are established by the LORD,
when he delights in his way;

24  though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong,
for the LORD upholds his hand.
```

#### Romans 8:26-29
```
Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. 27 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. 28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. 29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
```

#### Proverbs 3:5-8
```
5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
and do not lean on your own understanding.
6  In all your ways acknowledge him,
and he will make straight your paths.
7  Be not wise in your own eyes;
fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.
8  It will be healing to your flesh
and refreshment to your bones.
```

## What does God promise us?
- He provides a way of escape from temptation
- He will give you the desires of your heart
- He will act
- The Lord upholds his hand
- The Spirit will intercede for us according to God’s will
- All things work together for good
- Conformed to the image of the Son
- He will make our paths straight
- Healing to flesh / refreshment to bones

## What are the desires of our heart?
Notice the circular pattern here—the more we commit our ways to God and trust in him, the more he will give us growth in righteousness, which leads to more trust in God. <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
He changes our desires to be for Him.

## What does “straight paths” mean?
God won’t necessarily give us perfect direction for what we want out of life, he will show us what our paths are, according to His will. The more we surrender to Him, the more He shows us His desires for us.
