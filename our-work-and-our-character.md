#### Scripture 6:5-9
```json
5 Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, 6 not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, 8 knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or is free. 9 Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.
```

## Background
### Slavery
Some people read passages like this and see that the Bible condones slavery. This is not necessarily the case.

Paul wrote this letter to address Christians on Sunday morning. He talks to husbands and wives, parents and children, and slaves and masters. He wasn't talking about whether social institutions are `good` and what we as Christians should *do* about such social institutions, but how do we live now, with what we've been given.

Slavery in the time was different. Not good, but different. It wasn't racial, it wasn't based on kidnapping. When a country lost a war, the soldiers were enslaved for 10-15 years, and had rights. They could own land and other slaves, and could lodge legal complaints against their masters.

Paul is not saying "How can we abolish slavery" but rather "How can we live in it today?"

### Relevance to me
Some people always experience work as humiliating, grinding, and frustration. And everyone experiences these things sometimes. Just like 1st century slaves

We experience the same things, and fall into the same mindsets, but it applies to us to.

## Practical Principle #1
```json
7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,
```

Everyone back in the day addressed the masters of the household, since the slaves do what they're told. Paul addresses the slaves directly, respecting them as agents of their lives.

Then Paul says "In God's eyes, masters are absolutely equal to their servants"

All work is serving the Lord

Martin Luther found this out too. One of the reasons for the Reformation was to get rid of the social restraints put on people.

[Priesthood of all Believers](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-priesthood-of-all-believers/)

Back in that day people were told priests, monks, and nuns had a calling from God, and everyone else was whatever.

Whatever you do you can do for God, and watch how you treat people.

## Practical Principle #2
Slaves obey your **earthly** masters.

Paul is saying that we should respect and obey your master on earth, but know in your heart that Christ is your boss.

This does two things:
- It destroys underwork
- It destroys overwork

Underwork happens when you hate your boss and you only work when the eye of your boss is on you.

Overwork happens when you take pride in your work, and you are worried about salary and self-worth and wanting to please people.

Christ being your boss destroys **underwork** by being always present and **overwork** by being 

## Power
The Bible never tells you to do something without giving you the power to do it.

[Ephesians 5:21]()
```json
submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
```

Biblical fear / reverance: Joyful wonder at how He served you

[Psalm 130:4]()
```json
4  But with you there is forgiveness,

that you may be feared.
```

Jesus served you by dying. He served and worked for us while we were still enemies. We can serve Him and fear Him in everything, not just church
